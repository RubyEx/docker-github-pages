## What is GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages are public webpages hosted and published directly through your
GitHub repository.

## How to use this image

This image makes it easy to run you GitHub Pages page locally while developing â€“
refreshing changes automatically as you make them. All you need to do is to mount
your page in a volume under `/usr/src/app` like this:

```
$ docker run --rm -it -v "$PWD":/usr/src/app -p "4200:4200" starefossen/github-pages
```

Remember to add all the gems to your `_config.yml` file in order to get all the
different things to work correctly:

```
repository: your/repo

gems:
- jekyll-github-metadata
- jekyll-mentions
- jekyll-redirect-from
- jekyll-sitemap
- jemoji
```

Also, in order for the `{{ site.github }}` metadata variables to be poppulated
you need to set the `JEKYLL_GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable with your GitHub
token.

## Image Variants

The `starefossen/github-pages` images come in two flavors, each designed for a
specific use case.

`starefossen/github-pages:<version>`

This is the defacto image. If you are unsure about what your needs are, you
probably want to use this one. It is designed to be used both as a throw away
container (mount your source code and start the container to start your app), as
well as the base to build other images off of.

`starefossen/github-pages:onbuild`

This image makes building derivative images easier. For most use cases, creating
a `Dockerfile` in the base of your project directory with the line `FROM
starefossen/github-pages:onbuild` will be enough to create a stand-alone image
for your project.
